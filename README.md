# Vulkan Engine Tutorial

## Overview

This project is a result of following a tutorial series on Vulkan engine development available on YouTube by Brendan Galea. The tutorial covers the fundamental steps in creating a Vulkan-based rendering engine.

## Tutorial Source

The tutorial series is hosted on YouTube and created by Brendan Galea. You can find the tutorial series by visiting the following links:

## Tutorial Progress

In this Vulkan game engine tutorial, Brendan Galea includes a device file to wrap functionality surrounding Vulkan API device setup and continues working on the graphics pipeline. The pipeline creation is planned for the next video to provide detailed descriptions of each stage's configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/): GLFW is a multi-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing input.

- [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/): The official Vulkan Software Development Kit.

### Build and Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-vulkan-tutorial-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-vulkan-tutorial-repo
    ```

3. Build the project using your preferred build system (e.g., CMake, Makefile). in this case using visual studio 2022

4. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./your-vulkan-executable
    ```
